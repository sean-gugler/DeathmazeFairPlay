# Changes in the Fair Play edition

* Hint system revised

The HELP command was nearly useless. It only provided one hint for one puzzle. In all other circumstances, it gave a bland response that wasn't very helpful at all. This command (and its synonym "hint") have been re-assigned as synonyms for "instructions" and "directions", to re-display the introductory help screen. The one valid hint has been relocated to appear organically during a partial solve of that puzzle.

* SAY command removed

This command served no gameplay purpose whatsoever. It provided a modicum of player agency and atmosphere, allowing the player to express any arbitrary word and have it be acknowledged within the game's world.

However, the presence of this feature could also imply the existence of some "magic word" needed to solve a puzzle. There is none. Rather than create one and give the player false hope that disappointingly never materializes, I elected to simply remove the feature.

* Numbers allowed

In one situation, the game responds to numbers the player types in. Formerly, it required spelling out the name of the number, as in "Three". I allow the numeric "3" to work also.

* UNLOCK is a unique verb

There are times when "open" also implies "unlock", and this behavior is preserved. The converse is not true, though; it makes no sense that unlocking something that is not locked, when you have no key, should "open" it. The original game had them as strict synonyms. I have split them into separate verbs.

* DRINK added

There is a situation where this verb is a perfectly reasonable thing to try. So I've enabled that.
