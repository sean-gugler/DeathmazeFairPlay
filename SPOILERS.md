# Changes in the Fair Play edition

## Design revisions

* Hint system revised

The HELP command was nearly useless. It only provided one hint for one puzzle. In all other circumstances, it gave a bland response that wasn't very helpful at all. This command and its synonym "hint" have been re-assigned as synonyms for "instructions" and "directions" to re-display the introductory help screen.

The one valid hint was for the calculator puzzle. This has been relocated to appear organically during a partial solve of that puzzle. If you follow the display instructions literally, you'll get the old "invert and telephone" hint towards the proper solution. This provides partial confirmation for the player that the mechanic is correct, only the data is not right yet.

* LOOK command revised

More hints were added for a few objects when you LOOK at them. The bland "look at your monitor" response when LOOK is typed by itself is changed to offer the more helpful guidance "Look at what?" I replaced mention of HELP in the instructions with LOOK since it's a much more important command now.

* BALL more consistent

LOOK BALL now provides a colorful description of its violent nature. It also now activates on BURN, BREAK, and EAT, not just THROW and ROLL.

* FART hint

The original printed game manual had nearly the same text as the instructions you see upon starting a new game. One key difference was that it mentioned the verb "FART" instead of "CHARGE". This is a valuable clue for one of the puzzles. I could restore it here, since Charge already appears later in the game and doesn't need to be mentioned here. That doesn't feel as rewarding as figuring it out from a less direct hint inside the game, though. Instead, I've chosen to rephrase the "eat food" response to suggest gas.

* RING revision

The ring was originally the light source for level 5 after your torch goes out. Its magic light is activated by raising it ... but it confusingly only works on level 5. To improve the experience, I've changed it to glow hot when rubbed. It can then be used to re-light an extinguished torch. The glow only lasts for one turn but can be invoked over and over. This allows its purpose to be consistent and also discoverable much earlier. It shouldn't break the game duration limits because the torches are still limited in number. If anything, it imposes a new time limit on level 5 exploration in addition to starvation. Admittedly it also softens the game's harsh lethality by providing a recovery path after the torch goes out through use or by carelessly dropping it. Some might feel this dampens the spirit of the original game. I justify it by noting that those situations are still lethal if the ring is not engaged, and it adds satisfaction of solving one more puzzle.

* BRUSH purpose

There is now a reason for the brush to exist, and for the verb "paint" to exist. The "perfect square" made no sense. It's not a reference to anything I'm aware of and its appearance and description have nothing to do with its nature as a pass-through wall. All it does is mark that wall as special and worth experimenting with.

Instead, it is now a "magic door" and the jar comes pre-filled with black paint. Painting the door turns it into a real one. This references a trope from early cartoons. Even if the player is not familiar with the trope, the hints of calling it a "magic door", coloring it brightly, and finding black paint should be enough to make the solution fairly discoverable.

* DRINK verb

Since the jar can be full of liquid, I added the verb "drink". It's just another death trap, though.

* FRISBEE purpose

There is now a reason for the frisbee to exist, apart from being a death trap. If it can saw your head off, how about we use it to saw the monster's head off when it's helpless? Adding one step between kill monster and collect blood gives the frisbee a sensible purpose. I've given it a LOOK description to assist with hinting.

* YOYO purpose

There is now a reason for the yoyo to exist. Since it's establish that it can hit you in the eye, how about we turn that into a hint to hit something else in the eye? The monster encounter already has several steps, so we'll add it to the mother encounter. If you don't blind her first, she can dodge your sword attack.

* STAFF purpose

There is now a reason for the staff to exist. One of the most frustrating red herrings in the original game was the remarkably developed staff that ended up serving no purpose whatsoever. (That was the original motivator behind this entire project, actually.) So now it has one: the golden key is no longer freely given. It must be forged from golden parts with the staff when used properly in the correct location.

For extra fun, I've hidden one of the parts in a previously-inaccessible area on level 3 and changed one of the teleport destinations to reach it.

* HORN breaks off hat

I assumed it was a brass horn when I played. I think it's supposed to be an animal horn. That makes a lot more sense as something that would seduce a monster.

We already have rams horns on the hat; why not make one of them break off after charging? That also reduces time wasted trying to charge other walls in the game, which will never work.

I've put something else where the horn was (see below).

* WOOL replaced with BANANA

It never made sense that the wool disappears when you climb the snake into the monster's lair. There's no logical reason for this. Doubly strange if you weren't even carrying the wool, or hadn't discovered it yet. Like, what wool? And how would I know it had vanished if it's not even here?

The intended purpose for the wool is also not intuitive. Wool is used for keeping things warm, or spinning into yarn, or protecting fragile items against breakage. Maybe even soaking and squeezing the dye out of it - why else is it specifically "blue"? Throwing wool at a monster to entangle and trip it is not a well-known trope. If it's a reference to something, I'm not aware of it. There's no tie-in to the Grendel story, which would have at least been fair if obscure. This solution felt discoverable only by trying everything possible, by exhausting the verb/noun combinations. That's an unfortunately common but unpleasant trait of games from this era.

So what item can trip up a monster and would be stolen by a freed snake? How about a banana? True, real snakes won't eat bananas, but you can't climb a real snake charmed by a flute either. At least slipping on a banana peel is a much more well-known trope than getting tangled in wool. 

I didn't want to just remove the wool because I admire the solid logic chain of the core puzzle:

1. The player cannot reach the exit until the monster is dead.
2. The monster's mother guards the exit.
3. The sword is needed to defeat the monster's mother.
4. The snake is needed to reach the sword.
5. The roaming dog will be encountered on the way to fetching the snake.

If the dagger is used to defeat the dog, and the sword to defeat both the monster and its mother, then the sneaker would be superfluous. To make the sneaker mandatory, the sword must be prevented from being used against the monster. This is achieved with the following dependency chain:

1. Our everyman player is no match for the monster unless it is made vulnerable first.
2. The item that makes it vulnerable vanishes when the snake is freed.
3. The snake is needed to reach the sword.

Thus the player may experiment with skipping the dog or using the dagger against it, but will be unable to reach the exit unless the sneaker is used on the dog.

* CALCULATOR expanded

The criteria for when the calculator works and when it doesn't felt arbitrary and unjustified. So now it always works consistently. To preserve the puzzle gate of not being actually useful or effective until the monster is dead, it brings the monster with you.

It is now reusable as well, not only to encourage exploration without resorting to save games, but to give a purpose to having so many buttons. In the original design only one mattered. Since some of the "useless" items are now required and there is not enough inventory capacity to bring them all along at once, the ability to go fetch them later becomes important. The extra buttons now serve a vital purpose to be able to revisit earlier areas.

* STAFF swapped with FLUTE

Making the calculator re-usable undermines a puzzle in the original design: how to reach the item on the other side of the level 2 pit. One way is to defeat the guard dog, but doing so uses up an item needed elsewhere (dagger for monster, or sneaker for roaming dog). The other way is to discover the verb "fart".

By allowing multiple teleports, the sword could now be brought back to defeat the guard dog. In general it can be enriching to have more than one way to solve a puzzle, but it is poor design to have a mechanic (fart) whose sole usefulness can be bypassed. So we need a new interlock to prevent this solution.

Putting the flute behind the pit achieves this goal, because the flute is needed to reach the sword. It can still be reached for early experimentation before figuring out how to beat the monster, by defeating both dogs with dagger and sneaker. There wasn't much benefit in obtaining the staff early; unlike the flute and snake, the staff has no demonstrable effect on the world until very late in the game. After the monster is dead, the sword can optionally be used to defeat the guard dog - not needed to bypass the pit, just as an optional but satisfying "clean up" task.

The staff is now on level 4 - although not where the flute was. I've put something else of interest there (see below). The staff now occupies the place where the horn used to be.

* Make the level 1 pit real

After this pit is exposed, make it visible. This is more than just cosmetic; it is practical since the hat has been changed from re-usable to single-use.

Also, allow climbing from level 2 back up to 1 with the snake. This scenario is possible even in retail with use of the calculator, but you would disappointingly ram your head against the ceiling.

* Timing of monster tightened

To raise the tension on level 4 and enhance excitement, I've placed the jar where the flute was and reduced the monster timer so that it now appears in precisely the number of moves it takes to reach the jar and return to the elevator. The player is able to barely escape his clutches in the nick of time. This is a guaranteed experience because the jar is necessary to obtain the banana, which is required to defeat the monster.

The timing of the mother has also been tightened to make it just possible to obtain the golden hook but not escape alive with it. The mother must be defeated before the hook can be obtained. This guarantees the mother cannot be bypassed in solving the game, which was possible in the retail edition.

Since the jar's original location is now vacant, I placed one of the pieces of the golden key there.

* End game area extended

There was a ton of custom code to manage the end game sequence. Most of that was probably to disallow behaviors they hadn't or didn't want to fully test. I ripped it all out and pared down that special mode to its bare minimum.

I retained the "pillar of salt", but invoked it only if the player turned back towards the keyhole entrance, rather than for taking any action that deviated from the tightly-scripted final sequence of moves. The elevator is now a one-unit chamber containing the final riddle. Instead of a weirdly-personified narrator asking the question, which was inconsistent with the rest of the game's voice, I wrote the riddle on the wall. And instead of making the answer a custom verb, I employed the otherwise-unused "Say" mechanic.

Finally, instead of locking up the machine upon winning, I exit back to the operating system, same as when a player answers "No" to the "Play Again?" prompt.

## Quality of Life improvements

* World goes dark after a bad charge

Clear the screen after charging a steel wall. Consistent with other deaths like guillotine, monster, and bomb.

* "Darkens" message when appropriate

When the "disgusting odor permeates the hallway" message appears, retail added "as it darkens" only for mother encounter, not monster. I've changed it to print only when room is lit, for either foe.

* Numbers allowed

In one situation, the game responds to numbers the player types in. Formerly, it required spelling out the name of the number, as in "Three". I allow the numeric "3" to work also.

* UNLOCK is a unique verb

There are times when "open" also implies "unlock", and this behavior is preserved. The converse is not true, though; it makes no sense that unlocking something that is not locked, when you have no key, should "open" it. The original game had them as strict synonyms. I have split them into separate verbs.

* DRINK added

There is a situation where this verb is a perfectly reasonable thing to try. So I've enabled that.

* SWORD weight made reasonable

90 pounds is absurd. The heaviest real swords weigh about 7 (see link below). The weight is purely cosmetic, it doesn't affect game play at all. May as well retain player immersion better by demanding less suspension of disbelief. I removed the number and simply describe the sword as "heavy".

* DOG vs MONSTER

It is possible to avoid the dog entirely on Level 2, then return with the calculator after killing the monster. Throwing the sneaker had a scripted response that always mentioned getting eaten by the monster ... which should be impossible since it's already dead. I've fixed it so the dog will still chase the sneaker, even though it vanishes. This is not a victory because the dog reappears immediately next turn.

This scenario is also possible in the retail version so I incorporated my change into the fan-fixed version. The README is vague about the details to avoid spoilers.

* PLAY with dog

In the dog encounter, PLAY BALL is recognized. So is THROW BALL. You still die, but at least the stock answer "With who?" now has an answer.

* BALL works anywhere

The crystal ball can now be used to destroy any open door, not just the final one. This allows earlier discovery of its purpose. The destroyed door looks visibly altered as well.
