<p>These hints are layered to gently reveal suggestions with minimal spoilers. Hints marked "(!)" give explicit answers.</p>

<button class="collapse-button">
I keep starving
</button>
<div class="collapse-content">
<p>There is food to be found.</p>

	<button class="collapse-button">
	Where?
	</button>
	<div class="collapse-content">
	<p>Not on level 1.</p>

		<button class="collapse-button">
		(!) No, really - where and how many?
		</button>
		<div class="collapse-content">
		<p>Each level (except 1) has one food.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
<hr/>
</div>

<button class="collapse-button">
There is a season
</button>
<div class="collapse-content">
<p>Don't give up too soon. This is a tricky puzzle.</p>

	<button class="collapse-button">
	Is this a reference to something I should know?
	</button>
	<div class="collapse-content">
	<p>These are lyrics to a song by <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Byrds">The Byrds</a>.</p>

		<button class="collapse-button">
		(!) Does that matter?
		</button>
		<div class="collapse-content">
		<p>Only the words quoted in the game are needed to solve the puzzle.</p>
		</div>
	<hr/>
	</div>

	<button class="collapse-button">
	Have I done everything I need to do first?
	</button>
	<div class="collapse-content">
	<p>Probably.</p>

		<button class="collapse-button">
		(!) What exactly do I need to bring or do first?
		</button>
		<div class="collapse-content">
		<p>This puzzle is self-contained. Everything needed to escape the trap is in there.</p>
		</div>
	<hr/>
	</div>

	<button class="collapse-button">
	Am I missing some information?
	</button>
	<div class="collapse-content">
	<p>Spinning in place may feel pointless, but it does advance the game clock.</p>

		<button class="collapse-button">
		(!) How does spinning help?
		</button>
		<div class="collapse-content">
		<p>If you spin long enough, you get more complete song lyrics.</p>
		<hr/>
		</div>

	<p>Also, remember the general advice in the intro! Type <span>HELP</span> to re-read it.</p>
		<button class="collapse-button">
		What specifically in the intro is relevant?
		</button>
		<div class="collapse-content">
		<p>The suggested verbs are helpful.</p>

			<button class="collapse-button">
			(!) Please tell me exactly
			</button>
			<div class="collapse-content">
			<p>You get important information from <span>LOOK CALCULATOR</span>.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	<hr/>
	</div>

	<button class="collapse-button">
	I have everything, I'm just stumped. Give me a nudge.
	</button>
	<div class="collapse-content">
	<p>The calculator displays 3 digits and the song lyrics mention "TURN, TURN, TURN".</p>

		<button class="collapse-button">
		I need a bigger hint!
		</button>
		<div class="collapse-content">
		<p>One common type of <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_lock#/media/File:Masterpadlock.jpg">combination lock</a> has a dial. The dial is turned three times, in opposing directions, to the sequence of numbers required to open the lock.</p>

			<button class="collapse-button">
			(!) Please tell me exactly what to do.
			</button>
			<div class="collapse-content">
			<p><span>LOOK CALCULATOR</span> displays "317". Turn yourself to the <span>RIGHT</span> three times, then to the <span>LEFT</span> one time, then to the <span>RIGHT</span> seven times.</p>
			<p>If you make a mistake, reset by moving forward into any wall then start the sequence again.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	<hr/>
	</div>

	<button class="collapse-button">
	Are you laughing at me?
	</button>
	<div class="collapse-content">
	<p>If you hear a cruel laugh, then good job! You figured out how to operate the trap.</p>
	<p>But those aren't the right numbers.</p>

		<button class="collapse-button">
		You have got to be kidding me.
		</button>
		<div class="collapse-content">
		<p>I know, right? This has been called - SPOILER WARNING if you follow this link - <a href="https://bluerenga.blog/2019/07/14/deathmaze-5000-one-of-the-most-deeply-inscrutable-puzzles-in-adventure-game-history/">One of the Most Deeply Inscrutable Puzzles in Adventure Game History</a>.</p>
		<p>At least now you get a useful hint after trying the most direct solution. The original game gave no response at all for trying 3,1,7 and it only gave out "Invert and Telephone" if you explicitly asked for <span>HELP</span> - a verb that served no purpose anywhere else in the game. You were expected to complete all the solution steps in blind faith.</p>
		<p>My goal with the Fair Play edition was not to alter any puzzle solutions, only to make them more discoverable. So the original chain of logic remains; I've just tried to tighten player focus by only having relevant information appear at each step.</p>
		<hr/>
		</div>

		<button class="collapse-button">
		The phrase after the laugh makes no sense!
		</button>
		<div class="collapse-content">
		<p>The game is set in 1980. Calculators in that day used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display">"7-segment" LED displays</a>. Telephones had either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_dial">rotary dials</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push-button_telephone#/media/File:AT&T_push_button_telephone_western_electric_model_2500_dmg_black.jpg">key pads</a>.</p>

			<button class="collapse-button">
			How do I use that information for the puzzle?
			</button>
			<div class="collapse-content">
			<p>Reading the calculator display upside-down (inverted) makes the numbers look like letters.</p>
			<p>Each number on a telephone has letters also.</p>

				<button class="collapse-button">
				(!) Just tell me the answer.
				</button>
				<div class="collapse-content">
				<p>Imagine the calculator in an inverted position; the numbers 317 would look like the letters LIE.</p>
				<p>Next look up those letters on a telephone to find the numbers 543.</p>
				<p>Use that combination lock sequence to escape the trap.</p>
				</div>

<button class="collapse-button">
I keep getting beheaded
</button>
<div class="collapse-content">
<p>There is only one guillotine on level 1 and it doesn't move. Try making a map so you know where it is.</p>

	<button class="collapse-button">
	(!) How do I get past the guillotine?
	</button>
	<div class="collapse-content">
	<p>There is no way to safely go through it. The only way to get to the other side is by going around it. Find another path through the maze.</p>
	</div>
<hr/>
</div>

<button class="collapse-button">
I can't get past level 1
</button>
<div class="collapse-content">
<p>You need to find a specific item to reach level 2.</p>

	<button class="collapse-button">
	(!) Which item?
	</button>
	<div class="collapse-content">
	<p>The hat.</p>
	<hr/>
	</div>

	<button class="collapse-button">
	How do I use it?
	</button>
	<div class="collapse-content">
	<p>Check the general advice in the intro. Type <span>HELP</span> to re-read it.</p>

		<button class="collapse-button">
		What specifically in the intro is relevant?
		</button>
		<div class="collapse-content">
		<p>The suggested verbs are helpful.</p>

			<button class="collapse-button">
			(!) Please tell me exactly
			</button>
			<div class="collapse-content">
			<p>Make sure to <span>LOOK</span> at the item.</p>
			</div>
		<hr/>
		</div>

		<button class="collapse-button">
		(!) I know what to do but can't get it to work. What should I type?
		</button>
		<div class="collapse-content">
		<p><span>WEAR HAT</span>. Then face the wall you suspect can be knocked down, and type <span>CHARGE</span>.</p>
		</div>
	<hr/>
	</div>

	<button class="collapse-button">
	(!) Where do I use it?
	</button>
	<div class="collapse-content">
	<p>In the dead end where you picked it up, turn around to face the way you came in. Then follow the directions.</p>
	</div>
<hr/>
</div>

<button class="collapse-button">
My torch went out
</button>

<div class="collapse-content">
<p>There is another.</p>

	<button class="collapse-button">
	Where?
	</button>
	<div class="collapse-content">
	<p>Not on level 1.</p>

		<button class="collapse-button">
		(!) No, really - where and how many?
		</button>
		<div class="collapse-content">
		<p>Each level (except 1) has one torch.</p>
		</div>
	<hr/>
	</div>

	<button class="collapse-button">
	I know, but I can't light it
	</button>
	<div class="collapse-content">
	<p>You need a source of heat to light a torch. Make sure you light the new one before the old one dies.</p>

		<button class="collapse-button">
		What if it goes out early?
		</button>
		<div class="collapse-content">
		<p>In that case, you have to find some other heat source.</p>

			<button class="collapse-button">
			Do you mean a place or an item?
			</button>
			<div class="collapse-content">
			<p>There is an item that can help. Remember to LOOK at your items!</p>

				<button class="collapse-button">
				Which item is it?
				</button>
				<div class="collapse-content">
				<p>Did you notice the ring is dusty?</p>

					<button class="collapse-button">
					(!) How does that help?
					</button>
					<div class="collapse-content">
					<p><span>RUB RING</span>. It glows for one turn, giving you just enough time to <span>LIGHT TORCH</span>.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

<button class="collapse-button">
A vicious dog
</button>
<div class="collapse-content">
<p>You get one chance to defeat the dog. Choose your action carefully.</p>

	<button class="collapse-button">
	Do I need an item?
	</button>
	<div class="collapse-content">
	<p>Yes.</p>

		<button class="collapse-button">
		Where is the item?
		</button>
		<div class="collapse-content">
		<p>On level 1. Make sure you have found all the items up there.</p>

	<hr/>
	</div>

	<button class="collapse-button">
	Should I be violent?
	</button>
	<div class="collapse-content">
	<p>There are a few deadly items you could try.</p>

		<button class="collapse-button">
		(!) Which items, specifically?
		</button>
		<div class="collapse-content">
		<p>The ball, dagger, and frisbee.</p>

			<button class="collapse-button">
			(!) Tell me how to use them
			</button>
			<div class="collapse-content">
			<p>With the dagger in your inventory, <span>KILL DOG</span>. The other items are no help here, they still get you killed.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	<hr/>
	</div>

	<button class="collapse-button">
	Should I make friends?
	</button>
	<div class="collapse-content">
	<p>Most dogs do like to play games.</p>

		<button class="collapse-button">
		Can you suggest one?
		</button>
		<div class="collapse-content">
		<p>Try playing "fetch". Maybe he likes to chase things.</p>

			<button class="collapse-button">
			(!) Is there anything specific this dog will chase?
			</button>
			<div class="collapse-content">
			<p><span>THROW SNEAKER</span>. I promise he won't bring it back.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	<hr/>
	</div>

	<button class="collapse-button">
	Should I feed it?
	</button>
	<div class="collapse-content">
	<p>Dogs are often docile after being fed.</p>

		<button class="collapse-button">
		(!) What does it eat?
		</button>
		<div class="collapse-content">
		<p>You, and nothing else. Sorry.</p>
		</div>
	<hr/>
	</div>

	<button class="collapse-button">
	I thought I was done, but he came back!
	</button>
	<div class="collapse-content">
	<p>Actually, there are two dogs. One roams the halls, the other sits on guard duty.</p>

		<button class="collapse-button">
		How can I beat two dogs with one item?
		</button>
		<div class="collapse-content">
		<p>You can't. But there are alternatives.</p>

			<button class="collapse-button">
			(!) Can you be more specific?
			</button>
			<div class="collapse-content">
			<p>Try one of the other hint sections above. There is more than one way to defeat a dog.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
<hr/>

<button class="collapse-button">
Pits
</button>
<div class="collapse-content">
<p>Where to?</p>

	<button class="collapse-button">
	Going down?
	</button>
	<div class="collapse-content">
	<p>Just walk forward into a pit to descend.</p>

		<button class="collapse-button">
		But my stuff breaks
		</button>
		<div class="collapse-content">
		<p>Have you found any climbing gear?</p>

			<button class="collapse-button">
			(!) Tell me how
			</button>
			<div class="collapse-content">
			<p>Sorry, there is no safer way down. Anything that breaks is meant to do so.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	<hr/>
	</div>

	<button class="collapse-button">
	Going up?
	</button>
	<div class="collapse-content">
	<p>The walls are too sheer to climb.</p>

		<button class="collapse-button">
		So there's no way back up?
		</button>
		<div class="collapse-content">
		<p>Actually, with the right charm, it is possible.</p>

			<button class="collapse-button">
			Which item do I need?
			</button>
			<div class="collapse-content">
			<p>Two items, actually. Ever heard of snake charming?</p>

				<button class="collapse-button">
				No, what's that?
				</button>
				<div class="collapse-content">
				<p>Street performers in some countries will play music to make snakes rise slowly out of their basket.</p>
				<hr/>
				</div>

				<button class="collapse-button">
				That snake bites!
				</button>
				<div class="collapse-content">
				<p>There is a way to carry it around safely.</p>

					<button class="collapse-button">
					(!) How?
					</button>
					<div class="collapse-content">
					<p>Do not open the snake box. <span>GET BOX</span> and carry it where you need it to be, then <span>DROP BOX</span>.</p>
					</div>
				<hr/>
				</div>

				<button class="collapse-button">
				What's the other item?
				</button>
				<div class="collapse-content">
				<p>You will need a musical instrument. You might have to solve a different puzzle before you find it.</p>

					<button class="collapse-button">
					(!) Where is it?
					</button>
					<div class="collapse-content">
					<p>It's in the box across the pit on level 2.</p>
					</div>
				<hr/>
				</div>

				<button class="collapse-button">
				(!) Teach me how
				</button>
				<div class="collapse-content">
				<p>Do not open the snake box. Stand in the same square as it, so you cannot see it anymore, and <span>PLAY FLUTE</span>.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
	<hr/>
	</div>

	<button class="collapse-button">
	Getting across?
	</button>
	<div class="collapse-content">
	<p>There's no way to jump. You'll have to be more creative.</p>

		<button class="collapse-button">
		I've tried everything I can think of!
		</button>
		<div class="collapse-content">
		<p>You could go around. If you can't get past the guard, see the main hint section for that guard.</p>

			<button class="collapse-button">
			So there's no way directly across?
			</button>
			<div class="collapse-content">
			<p>Actually, there is a way.</p>

				<button class="collapse-button">
				Do I need an item?
				</button>
				<div class="collapse-content">
				<p>Eating well gives you the energy!</p>

					<button class="collapse-button">

<button class="collapse-button">
Doors
</button>
<div class="collapse-content">
<p>What about them?</p>

	<button class="collapse-button">
	How do I ride an elevator?
	</button>
	<div class="collapse-content">
	<p>Don't overthink it. Try the obvious things.</p>

		<button class="collapse-button">
		(!) Show me
		</button>
		<div class="collapse-content">
		<p>Face the elevator. <span>OPEN DOOR</span>. Move forward.</p>
		</div>
	<hr/>
	</div>

	<button class="collapse-button">
	Do I need to learn magic?
	</button>
	<div class="collapse-content">
	<p>Sort of. One door - you'll know which one when you see it - has a magic reaction to ordinary actions.</p>

		<button class="collapse-button">
		What kind of actions?
		</button>
		<div class="collapse-content">
		<p>Think about comedy tropes from vintage cartoons. Two items are needed to get through this door.</p>

			<button class="collapse-button">
			Which two items?
			</button>
			<div class="collapse-content">
			<p>The paint brush and the jar.</p>

				<button class="collapse-button">
				(!) I think I know what to do, but it isn't working.

	<button class="collapse-button">
	I can't get out!
	</button>
	<div class="collapse-content">
	<p>Some doors are traps. Once you enter, you're done for.</p>

		<button class="collapse-button">
		Is there a point?
		</button>
		<div class="collapse-content">
		<p>It's not called Deathmaze for nothing.</p>
		<p>However, there is a way to destroy them, if you're feeling vengeful.</p>

			<button class="collapse-button">
			How?
			</button>
			<div class="collapse-content">
			<p>Find something explosive.</p>

				<button class="collapse-button">
				(!) What do I do with it?
				</button>
				<div class="collapse-content">

That darn monster
</button>
<div class="collapse-content">
<p>The monster lurks in the dark, rarely coming out by light.</p>

	<button class="collapse-button">
	Is there any way to survive?
	</button>
	<div class="collapse-content">
	<p>There is! But the conditions have to be just right.</p>

		Do I have everything I need?

		<div class="collapse-content">
		<p>Have you been through the magic door?</p>

			<button class="collapse-button">
			No, what door?
			</button>
			<div class="collapse-content">
			<p>Keep exploring. You have to get through the magic door before you can defeat the monster. See the hints for that topic if necessary.</p>

			<button class="collapse-button">
			Yes. Now what?
			</button>
			<div class="collapse-content">
			<p>Think about how the unique item found there would have been used in old-time comedies.</p>

				(!) Am I using it wrong?

				<div class="collapse-content">
				<p>Did you <span>EAT BANANA</span> first?</p>

					<button class="collapse-button">
					How does that help?

					<div class="collapse-content">
					<p>Check your inventory after eating.</p>

			<button class="collapse-button">
			Yes but I die anyway.

			<div class="collapse-content">
			<p>The monster is too quick on his feet, you're no match for him. You have to find some way to slow him down.</p>

				<div class="collapse-content">
				<p>See the section above about the magic door.</p>
				<hr/>

		Is there somewhere special I need to be?
